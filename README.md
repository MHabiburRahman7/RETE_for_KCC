# RETE_for_KCC
this is for kcc 

It will focus on spatio temporal data
It is generated at Main.cpp
We will make this as real as possible

The input data is just simply
- Event Id
- Latitude
- Longitude
- ObjectID
- IFF
- ObjType

We skip the classification step. We consider that all of them is already classified 

Hope we can finish this on time :)
